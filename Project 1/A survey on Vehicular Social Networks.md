# A survey on Vehicular Social Networks



### NGV

- [x] Social Aware Networking with illustration
- [ ] Features of NGV

#### NGVs 

- [x] Increase safety envelope by using better sensors ed. LIDAR
- [x] In car computing systems for collision avoidance, speed control 
- [x] In car computing information based system handling traffic info etc.
- [ ] Vehicle diagnostic check such as fuel level, pressure etc.
- [x] ICCS - In car communication system

#### Social networks to vehicular networks

- [x] Social networks provide useful information such as logging information which keeps track of people density etc.
- [ ] Integration is mainly for safety and entertainment
- [ ] Intelligent traffic management helps generate a real time map that users can use to adjust their schedules.
- [ ] LoMoSo
- [x] Dissemination protocol based on similarity - drawback low efficiency of data delivery
- [x] issues with NGV - 1) lack of integration 2) privacy
- [x] SPRING - concept of deploying packets in RSUs
- [x] Techniques to establish trust between nodes. Also talk about public key infrastructure
- [x] Using certificates to give rewards 
- [x] Location privacy Spot based forwarding protocol. Social spots can be used as relay nodes containing packets that can not trace back to a specific vehicle. (Social Tier protocol) almost same concept of disseminate packets in social areas. Once receiver visits that area it can pick up the packet (forms social tiers). This saves receiver's location



### Vehicular Social Networks

- [ ] Derive SNA for at least one node.
